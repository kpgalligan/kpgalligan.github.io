I no longer remember how many "new blog" posts I've written, but here's another one.

<!--truncate-->

Over the past year I've learned quite a bit about [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). It's safe to say at this point that I love it. Markdown everything! Easy react extensions. Open source. It's fantastic.

We're slowly moving Touchlab open source repos to Docusaurus. Besides better formatting and navigation, we also do a little trick to place the latest library version directly in the docs.

The home page for this site is just react with tailwind as the CSS library. It would be great if Docusaurus had a tailwind template, but for now I've hacked everything to let the two systems reasonably coexist.
