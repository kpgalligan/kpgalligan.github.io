I couldn&#x27;t walk, because my legs basically didn&#x27;t work. That was new. Had to call 911, for the first time, because if I couldn&#x27;t walk I couldn&#x27;t stay in our apartment. I was rolled out into an ambulance. First ambulance ride, at least for me as the primary passenger.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Ambulance" src="/assets/images/ambulance-330648e6b022312756e2239c04342598.jpg" width="1512" height="1475" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>This is after gradually losing muscle strength since late December and early January. It started with needing two hands to pour coffee because I couldn&#x27;t lift the caraffe. Things progessively got worse, to the point where I got a rollator so I could go further than a block from our apartment. I decorated it with a Motorhead shirt for a night out.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Motorrollator" src="/assets/images/motorrollo-2999fd27956075f36514bdf793d78bae.jpg" width="1512" height="1030" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>I was diagnosed with Psoriatic Arthritis a year ago and started medications to deal with that. At its worst, the arthritis also caused some hand weakness, so I figured it was the same thing. I was switching PsA meds at the same time.</p><p>By late January, it was obviously not the arthritis. I tried getting into a neurologist, but the first availabilities were around June/July. Another doctor made some calls and got an appointment for 2/28, so I just needed to hold out for a few weeks.</p><p>By last Wednesday, getting in and out of bed was difficult, and I could only type about one sentence before I had to stop. Needed two hands to brush my teeth. That kind of thing.</p><p>Thursday morning, it took a few minutes to actually stand up, then I immediately fell. On the way down, there was a loud crack from my leg. After laying there for a bit, it seemed like I maybe sprained my ankle, but nothing was broken. I crawled out to the rollator, then sat to figure out what to do next.</p><p>I couldn&#x27;t walk. I couldn&#x27;t safely get into our bathroom. So, staying in the apartment seemed like a bad plan. We wound up calling 911 and getting an ambulance.</p><p>Thankfully, I was able to choose hospitals, so I went to NYU. All of my doctors are in the NYU system, and their Neurology program is ranked top in the country, so I figured that was the best place to go.</p><p>That was Thursday morning. There were no rooms, so I stayed in the ER until Friday afternoon, but other than that, care was excellent. In total, I had a spine MRI, CT scan, chest X-Ray, lumbar puncture (would not recommend that), and at least 10 blood test draws. Friday afternoon, I was moved into the 2nd best hospital room I&#x27;ve ever seen, and only because the other one was 2-3 times as big. Everything else about this room was better. The view, 65&quot; TV, tablet for controlling the TV, ordering food, controlling lights and temp, etc.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Tv and window" src="/assets/images/tv_window-2a83898e00aedd034d796548b6fdfe35.jpg" width="2016" height="1512" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Night view" src="/assets/images/nightview-358748d32e061773f88c14f10aadb020.jpg" width="2016" height="1512" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Sunrise" src="/assets/images/morning_sunrise-09b618cd70c8e95906041e2527296b07.jpg" width="2016" height="1512" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Tablet" src="/assets/images/tablet-37a6d929a5d90b3b5a5042fabd1c9540.jpg" width="2016" height="1512" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Originally I was going to stay through Tuesday, but recovery was so quick they let me out Sunday. While I was certainly happy to go home, by Sunday I was basically fine. That room would be pretty amazing if you could get around easily :)</p><p>Anyway, after all that, the diagnosis was <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/chronic-inflammatory-demyelinating-polyradiculoneuropathy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CIDP</a>. It&#x27;s an autoimmune condition where your body attacks the myelin sheath around your neurons. There&#x27;s no obvious &quot;test&quot; for that, except for the collection of symptoms and some test markers. There are several other pretty terrible things that my symptoms could&#x27;ve suggested (ALS, etc), but I was extremely lucky on that front.</p><p>It&#x27;s relatively rare, and probably caused by whatever respiratory virus I had mid December. Apparently what seems like a normal &quot;cold&quot; can trigger a response like this in rare cases.</p><p>I had 3 infusions of IVIG: Friday night, Saturday night, and Sunday afternoon. After the first one, Saturday morning, my hands were useful again, and I could get around with the walker. On Sunday, I could walk without the walker.</p><p><a href="https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/immunoglobulin-therapy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IVIG</a> is interesting. It&#x27;s made from processed blood donations. I haven&#x27;t done the Google-based medical research enough to understand it, but let&#x27;s just say it was magic. And if you can donate blood, please do so.</p><p>On Tuesday, 2/28, I went to that Neurology appointment. The doctor said it might be AIDP rather than CIDP. The difference is &quot;Acute&quot; vs &quot;Chronic&quot;. If it&#x27;s &quot;Acute&quot;, then I might be done. Chronic would mean IVIG every month or two, but we&#x27;ll cross fingers on &quot;Acute&quot;. Even if &quot;chronic&quot;, it&#x27;s not a big deal.</p><p>My hand and leg strength as of Wednesday, 6 days after the fall, seemed completely back to normal (except atrophy from lack of use, which should be built back up quickly). </p><p>So, Thursday, can&#x27;t walk or use my hands. 5-6 days later, back to normal. 2023 has already been pretty wild.</p><p>Please donate blood. That&#x27;s how they make IVIG. Also, a huge thanks to the NYU medical team. Everybody was amazing.</p></div></div><div class="max-w-2xl mx-auto md:max-w-none items-center"><div id="commento"></div></div></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Blog post page navigation"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/blog/2023/03/10/oss-updates"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Newer Post</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">oss-updates</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/blog/2023/02/16/Well-Hello"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Older Post</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Hello!</div></a></nav></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Kevin Galligan</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://kgalligan.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Website<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://touchlab.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Touchlab<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Community</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://twitter.com/kpgalligan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Twitter<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2023 Kevin Galligan</div></div></div></footer></div>
